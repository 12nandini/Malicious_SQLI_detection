# Malicious_SQLI_detection

SQL injection is one of the most popular hacking techniques, but also one of the oldest. Nearly 20 years since its discovery, and SQL injection news still relevant For one, itâ€™s used in an estimated two-thirds of web app attacks today.
SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content etc.
Using several machine learning algorithms like Decision Tree, SVM, KNN, Naive bayes and CNN into web applications can highly detect these attacks and prevent any major damages.
In this project we are doing a comparative study between all these algorithm and will use the best algorithm to predict if the given SQL query is malicious or not
